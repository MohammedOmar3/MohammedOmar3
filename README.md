## Hi there üëã, It's Mohammed
You're probably wondering where OMXMD comes from. Simply put, it's a unique blend of my name in Somali, shortened for style and simplicity.
<h4 align="center">Omar MaXaMeD</h4>

### About me:

I'm a passionate Software Developer working at Symology, where I primarily focus on backend development. My work involves building scalable and efficient systems, solving complex problems, and ensuring smooth integration between services.

To keep my skills sharp and versatile, I also take on frontend projects in my spare time. I believe in the importance of being a well-rounded developer, so I continuously explore the latest frontend technologies and tools to stay updated and refine my expertise.

Feel free to explore my repositories to see what I'm currently working on!

- üìù I have a blog at [https://omohammed.hashnode.dev/](https://omohammed.hashnode.dev/)
